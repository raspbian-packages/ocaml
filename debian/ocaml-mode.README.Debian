ocaml-mode for Debian
---------------------

 WARNING: tuareg-mode may be installed on your system. Since it
 has a higher priority than ocaml-mode, it will be used for
 every OCaml file loaded into (X)Emacs.
 
 If you absolutely want to override those default settings and
 use ocaml-mode instead of tuareg-mode, you only need to add the
 following line to your .emacs:

   (load-file "/etc/emacs/site-start.d/50ocaml-mode.el")
